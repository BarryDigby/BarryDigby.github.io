Similarly to the RNA-Seq analysis, we will be splitting time between LUGH and R to perform the scRNA-Seq analysis.

1. Nextflow tutorial + exercise *~1 hour*
2. Seurat QC + Differential Expression Analysis in R *~1 hour

Please install the following packages in R for the local analysis:

```
library(Seurat)
library(patchwork)
```
