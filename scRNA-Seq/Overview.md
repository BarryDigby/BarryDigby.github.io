Similarly to the RNA-Seq analysis, we will be splitting time between LUGH and R to perform the scRNA-Seq analysis. This week we will perform the downstream analysis in R

1. Seurat QC + Differential Expression Analysis in R *~ 50 mins*
2. `Kallisto Bustools` pipeline *~20 mins*
3. Nextflow assignment *~40 mins*

This is the final tutorial before your assignment, make an attempt at the nextflow assignment during the tutorial so we can answer any questions live.

Please install the following packages in R for the local analysis:

```
library(Seurat)
library(dplyr)
library(patchwork)
```
