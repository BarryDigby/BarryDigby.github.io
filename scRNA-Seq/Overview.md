Similarly to the RNA-Seq analysis, we will be splitting time between LUGH and R to perform the scRNA-Seq analysis.

1. `Kallisto Bustools` pipeline *~30 mins*
2. Seurat QC + Differential Expression Analysis in R *~1 hour*
3. Nextflow assignment *~30 mins*

This is the final tutorial before your assignment, try to make an attempt at the nextflow assignment during the tutorial so we can answer any questions live. 

Please install the following packages in R for the local analysis:

```
library(Seurat)
library(patchwork)
```
