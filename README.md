to reduce the number of pages, you could have an index.md file. 

in the yaml header name it accordingly and point to it in the sidebar file. 

create a directory for the index.md file, and all of the files it points to. 

Eg: 

Bash basics, topics covered - (blue clickable links to bring you to section of page) awk / sed / grep 
in the directory with index.md, have grep.md awk.md sed.md files.
