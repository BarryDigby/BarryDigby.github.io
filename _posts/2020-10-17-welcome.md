Welcome to Genomic Data Analysis II. This is an online repository containing all of the materials required to complete MA5112 tutorials.

Topics covered:

- [Week 1](http://barrydigby.github.io/Introduction/Overview): Create a Docker container using Anaconda. Pull the container using Singularity & integrate with Nextflow script for quality control analysis.  
- [Week 2](http://barrydigby.github.io/Variant_Calling/Overview): Perform Exome sequencing analysis via command line, translate to nextflow workflow.
- [Week 3]: Ask Shane for help here (ATAC/ChIP Seq).
- [Week 4](http://barrydigby.github.io/RNA-Seq/Overview): Create RNA-Seq quantification workflow in nextflow, perform Differential Expression analysis in R.
- [Week 5](http://barrydigby.github.io/scRNA-Seq/Overview): Create scRNA-Seq quantification workflow in nextflow, perform QC and analysis in R.
