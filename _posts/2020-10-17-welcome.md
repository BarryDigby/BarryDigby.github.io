title: Welcome!

Welcome to Genomic Data Analysis II! This is a new online repository containing all of the materials required to follow MA5112 tutorials to gain proficiency in handling and analysing NGS datasets on High Performance Computing clusters.

A little background on myself, I completed the BSc in Biotechnology at NUIG in 2015, the MSc in Biomedical Genomics in 2018 and entered the CRT PhD in Genomic Data Science in 2019. I have a keen interest in reporoducible science and workflow automation, topics which I will attempt to cover in tutorials to bring each of you to a proficient level in genomic data analysis. At the end of the module I hope each of you will have gained experience in bash scripting, nextflow scripting, SLURM job submissions, conda environments, Docker/Singularity containerisation, data analysis in R and python. This module should serve as a stepping stone to the MSc project where you will have large genomic datasets to analyse on your own.
