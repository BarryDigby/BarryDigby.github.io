The tutorial will be conducted both locally and on Lugh. The goal of this weeks tutorial is to get you comfortable designing your own containers, which play a huge role in creating reproducible workflows. This is the only week we will dedicate to creating containers, due to time constraints I will prepare containers for subsequent weeks analyses.

We will cover the following topics:

1. [Conda](http://barrydigby.github.io/Week_1/Conda): Install packages & create environments using a `yaml` file *~20 min*
2. [Docker](http://barrydigby.github.io/Week_1/Docker): Create Docker image using `Dockerfile` with a Conda layer. Store image on Dockerhub *~20 min*
3. [Singularity](http://barrydigby.github.io/Week_1/Singularity): Pull image from Dockerhub and convert to container *~20 min*
4. [Nextflow](http://barrydigby.github.io/Week_1/Nextflow): Create workflow pipeline performing QC on sequencing reads *~1 hour*
