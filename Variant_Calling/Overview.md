# Tutorial Overview
Before using nextflow to construct a workflow, it is imperative to understand what files are required for each step and what files are produced by each step. We will run the analysis in BASH before you will attempt to complete the analysis using a nextflow script.

The tutorial will be composed of:

1. Running the workflow in bash (1 hour)
2. Description of nextflow `getVal()` (10 min)
3. Alignment, Mark Duplicates exercise (40 min)
4. Execute full nextflow script (10 min)
