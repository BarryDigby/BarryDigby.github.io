# Tutorial Overview
Before constructing a nextflow workflow, it is imperative to understand what files are required and produced by each step. We will run the analysis in an interactive shell stepping through each phase of the pipeline before moving to nextflow scripting.

The tutorial will be composed of:

1. Work through the [pipeline](http://barrydigby.github.io/Variant_Calling/pipeline) *~1 hour*
2. Description of nextflow [getVal()](http://barrydigby.github.io/Variant_Calling/Nextflow) *~10 min*
3. Alignment, Mark Duplicates [exercise](http://barrydigby.github.io/Variant_Calling/Nextflow) *~40 min*
4. Execute full nextflow [script](https://github.com/BarryDigby/barrydigby.github.io/tree/master/Variant_Calling) *~10 min*
