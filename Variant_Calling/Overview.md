# Tutorial Overview
Before using nextflow to construct a workflow, it is imperative to understand what files are required for each step and what files are produced by each step. We will run the analysis in an interactive shell stepping through each phase of the pipeline to get comfortable with its requirements.

The tutorial will be composed of:

1. Work through the [pipeline](http://barrydigby.github.io/Varient_Calling/pipeline) *~1 hour*
2. Description of nextflow [getVal()](http://barrydigby.github.io/Variant_Calling/Nextflow) *~10 min*
3. Alignment, Mark Duplicates [exercise](http://barrydigby.github.io/Variant_Calling/Nextflow) *~40 min*
4. Execute full nextflow [script](https://github.com/BarryDigby/barrydigby.github.io/tree/master/Variant_Calling) *~10 min*
